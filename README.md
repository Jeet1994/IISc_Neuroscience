1. Psychopy: contains basic codes and tutorials for psychophysics experiment
2. Picameratimestamp: benchmarking values got after using datetime library for frame timestamp
3. graphMatplot: plotting example for matplotlib library
4. piNeuralynx: neuralynx file formats input and output along with file splitter on the basis of events
5. positiontracking: different codes used for tracking position of animals during neuroscience experiments
6. pistremaandrecord: lets you record as well as stream video over web browser. Motivated from https://github.com/waveform80/pistreaming
